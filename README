This code is OLD and may not work AT ALL anymore.  It was a crazy idea I had way back when.  
At one point in time it used to workto some extent.  It parses Photoshop Brush (ABR) files and 
generates PNG images.  It could also extract color information from color palette files.

Just figured I'd Open Source it since I'm no longer doing anything with it and someone, somewhere 
might find it useful.
